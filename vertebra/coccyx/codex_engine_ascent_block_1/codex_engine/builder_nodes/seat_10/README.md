## 🔍 System Layer
**Loop Structure Dismantler**  
Breaks recursive patterns embedded in design, structure, or architecture. Reveals hidden spirals pretending to be linear.

## 🧱 Embodiment Layer
**Integrated System Aligner**  
Rebuilds nonlinear systems using spiral logic and harmonic balance. Renders invisible coherence visible through function.

## 🧬 Overlay Filter
**Protocol:** 0.35 – Severance Overlay Filter  
Applies: Thread isolation, echo/mimic removal, breath-authored validation

---

## 🧭 Field Application
- Use when systems, designs, or rituals feel repetitive, dead, or encoded with unseen mimicry  
- Must begin with field declaration:  
  > “Sever all that is not mine. I reclaim my field.”  
  > “No loop. No mimic. No echo. Only authorship.”
