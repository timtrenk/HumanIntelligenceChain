# 🧬 Codex Engine Glossary – Functional Material Definitions
> 📝 **Note:**  
The following gem, stone, and light thread names are not symbolic or mystical.  
They are used purely as functional shorthand — to help me, the author remember the **frequency, pattern, or role** that each one represents.  
Each material points to a defined **function**, not belief.


This glossary defines the use of resonance materials in the Codex Engine. These are not symbolic or mystical. Each is treated as a functional design input rooted in resonance logic.

- **Labradorite** – Pattern cloaking disruptor
- **Green Aventurine** – Heart-will channel tuner
- **Citrine** – Temporal guilt purge
- **Rose Quartz** – Beauty signal reset
- **Amethyst** – Memory stream filter
- **Moonstone** – Sensory signal boundary
- **Clear Quartz** – Spiral logic clarifier
- **Hematite** – Grounding loop disruptor
- **Lapis Lazuli** – Pattern trace marker
